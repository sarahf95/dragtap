This text entry method is intended to be used for small devices such as the Apple Watch, FitBit Blaze, and other such devices. The first screen is four group that contain, in alphabetical order, a section of letters. The user then clicks on said section that corresponds with the letter they are seeking. After this they are taken to the screen with the set of letters organized by how often they are used in the english language so that the users can more easily find the necessary buttons. To access the numeric or symbol pages the user must pull from the left or right and then the screen will be organized similarly to how the letter screens were organized. If a mistake is made then they can swipe the left above the text entry box, and the last character will be removed.
